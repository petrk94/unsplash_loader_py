Unsplash_loader_py is a script written in Python which is parsing and extracting the
last image from the Unsplash.com RSS feed. Currently its working on Linux and Windows,
later I will make maybe a MacOS X Version.

In the OSÂ´s folder you can find the py-file and a README file where you can find all
necessary libaries which you need to run the script.

I would be glad if you can share it and give me feedback.
